# Diagrams Manual Evaluation

Single point annotation tool for the diagram generation project: 
code on one side, diagrams on another.

Please see [INSTALL.md](\INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

Note that this tool was not tested for security issues (they are probably numerous),
so we strongly suggest one should use it in a safe internal environment.
